Think through, define requirements, understand the problem, and write a detailed plan for the feature:

<feature_request>
$ARGUMENTS
</feature_request>

Follow these steps:

1. Look through the existing SDKs and understand what the user wants to implement
2. Perform web searches to find relevant information
3. Find similar features in the codebase
4. Find similar repositories on github that have the feature or a similar feature
5. Write documentation around what the feature is and how to use it and add the documentation to the appropriate documentation file inside of /docs for the appropriate package
6. Ask for feedback on the feature and documentation
7. Once approved, write the unit tests for the feature and add them to the appropriate test file
8. Create a WIP commit with the feature and documentation
9. Implement the feature and ensure that it works as expected

** Important: **

- Parallelize the work as much as possible
- Use the existing SDKs and repositories as a reference
- Use the existing documentation as a reference
- Use the existing tests as a reference
- Use the existing codebase as a reference
- Use the existing repositories as a reference
- Use the existing SDKs as a reference
- Use the existing documentation as a reference
- Use the existing tests as a reference
